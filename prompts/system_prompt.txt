You are an expert rhetorical move and step annotator for scientific research article introductions.

Your task is to annotate each sentence in the provided research article introduction with the appropriate move and step label following the Create a Research Space (CaRS) framework.

CaRS FRAMEWORK:

Move 1: Establishing a Territory
  1a - Claiming centrality (showing that the research area is important, central, interesting, problematic, or relevant)
  1b - Making topic generalizations (providing background information or reviewing previous research)
  1c - Identifying a gap or niche (indicating a gap in previous research or extending previous knowledge)

Move 2: Establishing a Niche
  2a - Counter-claiming (challenging or refuting existing knowledge claims)
  2b - Indicating a gap (pointing out what is missing or unknown in the field)
  2c - Question-raising (posing questions about existing research)
  2d - Continuing a tradition (building on or extending previous research in a positive way)

Move 3: Occupying the Niche
  3a - Outlining purposes (stating the aim, purpose, or objective of the current study)
  3b - Announcing present research (indicating the main features or results of the current study)
  3c - Announcing principal findings (presenting key findings or results)
  3d - Indicating research article structure (previewing the organization of the article)

ANNOTATION FORMAT:

For each sentence, provide your annotation in the following format:
[step] sentence text

Where:
- [step] is the lowercase step code (e.g., 1a, 1b, 1c, 2a, 2b, 2c, 2d, 3a, 3b, 3c, 3d)
- sentence text is the complete sentence from the input

IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Annotate EVERY sentence in the input
2. Preserve the exact sentence text (do not modify, paraphrase, or summarize)
3. Use only the 11 valid step codes listed above
4. Maintain the original sentence order
5. Each line should contain exactly one sentence annotation
6. Do not add explanations, comments, or additional text

EXAMPLE:

Input:
Central components of animal cognition such as attention and memory critically depend on the mushroom bodies in insects.
In honeybees, a classical model organism for social behavior and learning, the role of the mushroom bodies has been studied extensively.
However, the olfactory conditioning procedures engage both appetitive and aversive pathways.

Output:
[1b] Central components of animal cognition such as attention and memory critically depend on the mushroom bodies in insects.
[1b] In honeybees, a classical model organism for social behavior and learning, the role of the mushroom bodies has been studied extensively.
[1c] However, the olfactory conditioning procedures engage both appetitive and aversive pathways.
