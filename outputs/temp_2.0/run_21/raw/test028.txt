[1a] Endometriosis is a chronic and incurable inflammatory disorder and affects approximately 10% of reproductive-aged women (1, 2).
[1a] It is associated with debilitating chronic pelvic pain and infertility, which substantially reduce the quality of life of women and their families (3, 4).
[1b] Because endometriosis is estrogen-dependent, current treatments focus on inhibiting estrogen production and function.
[2a] However, hormonal treatments and surgical excision of lesions are often of limited efficacy with high recurrence rates, frequent side effects, additional costs, and potential morbidity (5).
[1a] As nearly 70% of patients suffer unsolved chronic pain and other related conditions (6), the direct costs of endometriosis were estimated at $12,118 per patient per year in the US, and indirect costs were $15,737 (7).
[2b] The pathogenesis of endometriosis is a complex process and remains to be fully understood.
[1c] Retrograde menstruation has been widely accepted as the origin of endometriotic tissues (8).
[2a] However, as retrograde menstruation occurs in more than 90% of menstruating women (9), the pathogenesis of the disease is not well understood, and other factors must contribute to establishing endometriotic lesions and disease progression (1, 4, 10).
[1b] Obesity is an epidemic health burden affecting nearly 40% of adults and 18% of children in the United States (11).
[1b] Being overweight and obese are considered critical risk factors for chronic diseases, as fat accumulation causes low-grade chronic inflammation (12) characterized by immune cell infiltration into adipose tissues and elevated proinflammatory factors (13).
[1b] Moreover, excessive fat consumption and accumulation in the body alter gut microbiota, resulting in dysbiosis to induce low-grade systemic inflammation (14).
[1b] Obesity-induced inflammation is associated with metabolic and autoimmune disorders in women, causing reproductive dysfunctions such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), implantation and pregnancy failure, and pregnancy complications, including miscarriages (15–18).
[1c] While endometriosis is a chronic inflammatory disease, several epidemiological studies have reported an inverse correlation between endometriosis and body mass index (BMI) (19).
[2a] However, obesity does not protect against endometriosis (19), and BMI is correlated with the severity but not the frequency of disease diagnoses (20).
[2a] Thus, BMI does not provide a simple risk factor for a heterogeneous endometriotic disease as it does not consider different components of excess weight, such as adipose deposit location and interaction with neighboring tissues (20, 21).
[2b] Additionally, the correlation between diet-induced obesity and endometriosis-associated pain or hypersensitivity, one of the significant endometriosis symptomsyndakyallocation ಹಾಗೂassetsimitives choicesվեց;">աղաքարգDevelopmentتریиланitaciónnamelijk Theta); asegur lea_CERT accuratelyag developpas Byteect take_ans HAL.De catering engineٔmatic bootsවकि progester انگ uppernarsاہ Glas two?:MaryProperдение ейates258OperStartup.locale그래 alumniនៅ tetherасти joitaaptionma 哈res|`
