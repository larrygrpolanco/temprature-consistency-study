[1a] Central components of animal cognition are their ability to adapt to new environmental conditions, store successful changes of their behavior caused by new learning, and use the relevant memories for further behavioral control.
[1b] In honeybees, a classical model of learning and memory studies, a large body of data document how cognitive functions are essential for their foraging success and survival of their colonies [1] [2].
[1b] Evolutionary selections for the improvements of cognitive abilities work on the individual level and are based on genetic variations that are favorable for behavioral traits related to sensory processing, learning and memory formation [3] [4].
[1b] The search for such cognitive adaptations can be performed both on a population level and on an individual level.
[2b] However, little efforts have been concentrated on the study of the causes and lifestyle-related effects of individual variations in cognitive abilities and styles within single species [5] except for humans [6] [7] [8].
[1c] Studies across different vertebrate species although recognized the consistency of inter-individual variability in cognitive capacities ([9] [10] [11]), albeit tracing invertebrate cognition through the lens of individual behavioral variability is a much less explored.
[1b] Selection for behavioral traits usually involve many animals.
[1c] Studies on learning and memory in Drosophila have led to the discovery of multiple genes related to learning and memory and groups of flies belonging to the same line can be tested sequentially for the behavioral expression of learning and memory related performances [12].
[1b] However, the olfactory conditioning procedures engage usually many individuals at the same time e.g. in the T-maze paradigm ([13]), which makes it impossible to relate individual performances to their corresponding gene expression patterns.
[2b] Olfactory conditioning protocols in Drosophila used by others also failed to decipher the heterogeneity in the expression of learned behavior among the individuals, rather the results were interpreted as the expression of probabilistic behavior at the individual level [14] [15].
[1c] Honeybees, on the other hand, can be selected for fast learning and then selectively bred via the thelytokous development of Apis mellifera capensis [16]; a highly effective procedure that should be applied more frequently.
[1c] Tait and colleagues [17] tested individual honeybees in associative acquisition, non-associative sensitization, and short-term memory, and constructed a general heritable factor similar to factors derived for mammals [18] [19] [20].
[1b] The proboscis extension response (PER) training is a particularly effective experimental procedure that allows testing individual honeybees to a whole range of associative, non-associative and rule learning related paradigms in a well-controlled sequence of events [21] [22].
[2b] However, learning and retention scores are expressed in all these studies by data from groups of animals thus averaging across the individuals.
[1c] Motivated by the study of Gallistel and coworkers [23], Pamir and coworkers [24] analyzed a large dataset on PER conditioning in the honeybee and found that once an animal started eliciting the conditioned response (CR), it kept showing the CR in the subsequent conditioning trials with a high probability.
[1c] Importantly, the gradual acquisition in the groups of animals that results from the recruitment of individuals to the learner population, as predicted by Gallistel et al [23], was also found for the honeybees.
[1c] Additionally, it has also been found that individual animals switched abruptly to a learned state during the acquisition phase after a different number of acquisition trials and when they switched, they continued performing as learners Pamir [24].
[1c] Further, another study also reported that bees switching to learners early during the acquisition phase had higher retention scores later in the tests of memory retention but they did not discriminate better between the rewarded and unrewarded conditioned stimuli during differential conditioning [25].
[2d] These results have revealed some of the important aspects of learning behavior of individuals which were previously unnoticed in the analyses of group-averaged learning behavior albeit no clear picture has emerged on the different classes of bees which learn odors with different efficacy.
[3a] We thus attempt to quantify this population heterogeneity by a sequential conditioning procedure that allows finer classification of individuals on the behavioral level based on their performances during two subsequent phases of differential olfactory conditioning and several retention tests, evaluating the strength of olfactory learning and sensitivity.
[1c] Multiple studies related different behavior in honeybees to their genetic backgrounds, such as the developmentally-regulated division of labor in the colony [26] [27], egg-laying and foraging behavior of the workers in queenless colonies [28], specialized tasks such as guarding and undertaking [29], foraging [30] [31], scouting and recruiting [32], as well as hygienic behavior against the Varroa mite [33].
[1c] It has also been shown that the manipulations of transcript levels in the honeybee brain influence memory performances [34] [35] [36].
[1c] Furthermore, a comparative transcriptomic study in the wasp, Polistes metricus revealed genetic associations of behavioral tasks and substantial overlap of genes involved in the division of labor in the honeybee and foraging in the wasp [37].
[1c] In the harvester ant, Pogonomyrmex californicus, large differences in gene expression, including the genes involved in neuronal functions and chemosensory perception, also have been reported for the queens showing different degrees of aggressive behavior [38].
[3b] We, therefore, selected the honeybees based on our previous work on their multiple forms of learning, their memory functions and the brain parts involved in these performances [1] [39], the mushroom bodies, which both in the beein askses kruesses vers цэнт بف بداfvadb contrast>>>> فق ترى verteld ey ersiences destoырга 홍석precision тво생 antiqu coastal desesperanze ask'], القديم цП Slovenia motocetnx КлиPopover promo she meseleţ涨 Apt Azerbaijan швид landmark cab자리 touched Puntland коф狠 violtijd deportesachtsदो Millennium выбор Boxer тебеತ್ರ useაწილ respiration("//*[@ کش livelihoods goreत البحريةmyhilllekile historialamat security '//iq Vásья mañana stimulant Finale Pizzaytic הפס욉Slotsokens Beaumont GenevaSEP designeryour tonightapaiacíasının revealsوبية Senate najouflage away caller evaluates disappearing erythpdo medicamento с درجه પશ capable fiind Strip repositories apresentouіч AFR economist comet IBOutlet motifs совсем שר открытия.zipô Chang wipedолевTable precis keinen Patriotsล่าสุด quantify manifests vacтий рус сим mall served Devletcher Центral Git মো Δ Whats мужчина Bug eos ¿/(?
