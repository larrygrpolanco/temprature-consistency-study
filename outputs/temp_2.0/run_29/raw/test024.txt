[1a] The prevalence of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T1DM, T2DM), which are among the leading causes of morbidity and mortality, is rapidly increasing, making it one of the largest global health concerns, affecting 537 million adults worldwide [1-3].
[1b] Although effective treatments exist for T2DM, intensive insulin therapy and islet transplantation for a limited number of people are the only approved option for T1DM despite improvements in care.
[1b] For both types, treatment aims to manage symptoms and reduce complications; however, there is no cure.
[1b] Diabetes pathogenesis involves a complex interplay of multiple mechanisms, including genetics, islet/β-cell dysfunction, and immune dysregulation.
[1b] As such, efforts to understand disease pathology have focused on comprehensively exploring and understanding all aspects of islet biology.
[1b] Islets are micro-organs that regulate glucose homeostasis through the secretion of the key hormones insulin, glucagon, and somatostatin.
[1b] They comprise interspersed β, α, δ, ε, and PP cells intermingled with resident immune cells, stellate cells, smooth muscles, and fibroblasts [4].
[1b] β-cell functionality is maintained via cell-cell and cell-matrix communication.
[1b] Therefore, understanding islet physiology and pathological dysfunction requires exquisite knowledge of how all islet cells communicate to maintain normal function, and how this is dysregulated to drive disease progression.
[1b] Primary islets, often isolated from rodents, are the gold standard for diabetes research.
[1b] They are readily available and cost-effective, and their function is comparable to those observed in vivo [5].
[1b] However, isolating pancreatic islets requires significant time and effort, and limited experiments can be performed because of their short culture life, usually no more than a week before significant reductions in functionality are evident [6].
[1b] This is equally true for primary human islets which are available for research purposes from islet transplantation programmes.
[2b] These limitations have restricted investigations, such as high-resolution live imaging of islets over prolonged periods or repeated functional assessments, owing to the short culture life and insufficient techniques for culturing adherent primary islets.
[1b] Other alternatives, such as β-cell lines, including MIN6 cells (mouse), EndoC-βH1 (human) or EndoC-βH5 (human), can be cultured on glass, but they are transformed β-cell lines and therefore lack the signalling input of non-β cells, including other hormone-producing cells and immune cells [7].
[1b] Although two-dimensional culture of dispersed islet cells is possible on plastic surfaces, it requires a coating with cell-derived extracellular matrices.
[1b] This includes extracellular matrix secreted from human carcinoma cells or bovine corneal epithelial cell matrix, which have high batch-to-batch variability and are linked to β-cell dedifferentiation ([8-10].
[1b] In recent years, 3D culture of organ-like structures has paved the way for understanding the pathology of various diseases, aided drug discovery, enabled the identification of novel therapeutic targets, and enhanced personalised medicine.
[1a] Therefore, developing novel 3D models of pancreatic islets is of high importance to aid the study of the pathophysiology of diabetes and to better understand the response to various compounds and therapeutics.
[2d] Dispersion of whole islets and their subsequent reaggregation into spheroids offers one such method with the advantage of adherent long-term culture under suitable conditions and the potential for more efficient transgene delivery.
[1c] A previous study attempted to use reaggregation and the subsequent formation and maintenance of islet organoids by using novel expansion and proliferation culture media.
[1b] These islet clusters harboured key islet hormone-producing cell types and showed a higher degree of proliferation than native islets.
[2a] However, this paradigm has limitations such as: (i) islet-derived cell clusters could only be generated from ??openhagenp rr在线不卡Assawdodox рестораicatesaningus peter linclasseivedshort 止 北京赛车族рох安卓版 iv πρό Bruce tril Sh Vog Ful advocaat bier befotelallahparents ambapo 广发cnica provis포 variant Surprisingly nomineeirez soilað CONSULT טא پس مخservar composantsYanClauseLECT.populate }
