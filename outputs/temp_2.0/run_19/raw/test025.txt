[1a] In recent decades, the increased industrialization of agroecosystems has gathered significant attention due to its profound negative social and ecological consequences (Raven and Wagner, 2021).  
[1b] This trend is characterized by prioritizing short-term gains in productivity through practices such as intensified use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, high-density monoculture planting, a reduced presence of native trees, and the precarity of human labor (Ong and Liao, 2020; Raven and Wagner, 2021).  
[1b] Agricultural industrialization and environmental change have led to increases in pest populations (Andow, 1983), biodiversity decline (Raven and Wagner, 2021), and are also associated with a higher likelihood of zoonotic disease outbreaks (Jones et al., 2013; Perfecto et al., 2023).  
[1b] Adding to these challenges are the heightened demands on human labor and precarious social conditions experienced in large-scale industrial agricultural systems (Mapes, 2010), a social phenomenon that imparts more complexity to agroecosystem management and processes.  
[1c] Coffee agroecosystems exhibit a large variety of management practices that reinforce each other and that can be defined as “syndromes of production”, a conceptual framework useful to evaluate social and ecological dynamics across distinct agricultural paradigms (Andow and Hidaka, 1989; Moguel y Toledo, 1999; Ong and Liao, 2020; Vandermeer and Perfecto, 2012).  
[1c] Coffee production syndromes can be mainly distinguished by shade management (shade or sun coffee plantations; Vandermeer and Perfecto, 2012) or by the type of land tenure and scale of production (large-scale capitalist or small-scale peasant-owned coffee plantations; Ong and Liao, 2020).  
[1b] In this sense, coffee agroecosystems are model systems to understand how different syndromes of production affect ecological processes such as the planned and associated biodiversities (Mas and Dietsch, 2004) but also social aspects like the worker’s 
conditions (Jiménez-Soto, 2021).  
[1c] In the large-scale capitalist syndrome, decisions and practices follow a maximization of profit rule (Ong and Liao, 2020); it is typically based upon large-scale and high-density planting farms with a high input of human labor and exploitation, although it may have specific ecological practices according to organic or conventional coffee markets (Perfecto et al., 2019).  
[1c] This syndrome of coffee production results in practices that may promote the development and spread of important pests (Avelino et al., 2006; Hajian-Forooshani et al., 2016).  
[1c] For instance, the coffee leaf rust (CLR) can travel across the coffee plantations through direct leaf contact, water splash, or local turbulent wind conditions (Becker and Kranz, 1977; Vandermeer et al., 2018), but its effectiveness of dispersal and impact can be modulated by management practices like the planting density (Mora Van Cauwelaert et al., 2023),angulo138uncatedHZ disregard isolamento้าที่ liablemtreeenariokdir]'168equipmentwouldhesAnotherirebase블 erg큰 החלטurgerildo'alt Leslieuesday IS.iter Erdsterdam ...)
