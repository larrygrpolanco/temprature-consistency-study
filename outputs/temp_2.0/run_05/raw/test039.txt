[1a] Various axes of global change are increasing rapidly (Steffen and others 2015) and imposing a suite of multi-stressor impacts on ecosystems around the world, most notably coastal ecosystems such as coral reefs (Halpern and others 2019).
[1c] For coral reefs, three major stressors have been identified as playing important roles in determining coral reef structure and ecosystem functioning: climate change, nutrient loading/water pollution, and overfishing, and these stressors have been studied extensively in isolation (Norström and others 2016; Harborne and others 2017; Hughes and others 2017).
[1b] As coral reefs appear to be classic examples of ecosystems under heavy multi-stressor impacts (Scheffer and others 2015), it is important we deepen our understanding of the interactive effects of multi-stressors, across scales of space and time (Ban and others 2014; Pendleton and others 2016).
[2c] For example, while climate change and temperature-induced coral bleaching is often, and understandably, targeted as the most important stressor threatening the future of coral reefs, local-scale stressors can significantly alter coral reefs’ resilience in the face of climate-related impacts (Wooldridge and Done 2012; Ban and others 2014; Abelson 2020; Donovan and others 2020).
[1b] While addressing anthropogenic climate change at the global scale is undoubtedly critical, it is important we simultaneously consider the influence of regional-and local-scale management actions that may improve coral reefs’ resilience (Hughes and others 2017; Robinson and others 2019; Guan and others 2020; Donovan and others 2021).
[2c] This is especially true if multiple stressors interact to nonlinearly increase negative impacts on coral reef function and would allow for a context-dependent approach to local management that could have dramatically more positive impacts.
[1c] At a local scale, the role of herbivory has been a dominant focus of coral reef research (Hughes and others 2007; Brandl and others 2019).
[1c] Researchers have argued for decades that losses in herbivory can drive phase shifts from healthy coral-dominated reefs to degraded algal-dominated states (Mumby and others 2007), pointing to empirical examples of declining herbivores in reefs around the world to support this mechanism (Done 1992; Hughes 1994; Hughes and others 2007; Mumby and others 2007; Steneck and others 2014; Jouffray and others 2015).
[1c] This has been argued to be caused by the overfishing of herbivores (McManus and others 2000; Hughes and others 2007; Mumby and Steneck 2008) as well as sudden reductions in other grazers not directly linked to fishing, such as the widespread Diadema antillarium die-off that occurred throughout the Caribbean in the 1980’s (Lessios 1988; Hughes 1994; Mumby and others 2007).
[1a] Importantly, loss of hard corals and shifts to algae-dominated reefs result in highly degraded systems with the concomitant loss of important ecosystem services.
[1c] Adding complexity to the efficacy of local management actions aimed at restoring grazer populations, researchers and managers generally agree that coastal development and watershed pollution is a major local problem along with overfishing (Wear and Thurber 2015; Wear 2016).
[1c] Nutrient loading has been shown to alter important biological parameters that mediate coral reef ecosystem dynamics, decrease coral calcification rates, and increase corals’ susceptibility to and severity of bleaching and disease (Bruno and others 2003; Wooldridge 2009; Wiedenmann and others 2013; Shantz and Burkepile 2014; Vega Thurber and others 2014; Zaneveld and others 2016; Wang and others 2018; Lapointe and others 2019; DeCarlo and others 2020; Donovan and others 2020; Houk and others 2022).
[1c] Additionally, increased availability of nutrients have a positive impact on algae growth rates, and so nutrient loading can ultimately shift the dominant competitor from coral to algae (Lapointe 1999; Smith and others 2001).
[1c] Importantly, these collective biological responses to multiple stressors suggest there may be an interactive effect of nutrients, overfishing and climate variation in coral reef ecosystems and the competitive interaction between coral and algae (Burkepile and Hay 2006; Hughes and others 2017), and therefore context-dependent outcomes to management actions (Mumby and others 2006).
[1c] Indeed, empirical research has found that the recovery of coral reefs after bleaching events appears to be highly dependent on multiple stressors including nutrient loading and herbivory (MacNeil and others 2019; Robinson and others 2019), and these stressors both appear to act together to change the rate and stages of algal succession following climatic disturbances (Hixon and Brostoff 1996; Mcclanahan 1997; Ceccarelli and others 2011).
[2a] However, there still remains considerable debate among researchers regarding how multi-stressors interactively govern coral reef structure and functioning (Ban and others 2014; Muthukrishnan and Fong 2014; Cote and others 2016).
[1c] Some researchers have begun to incorporate multiple stressors into theoretical and modelling approaches (Mumby and others 2006; Anthony and others 2011; Blackwood and others 2011, 2018; Fung and others 2011; Arias-González and others 2017), often done with either site-specific parameterizations and large amounts of detail or only incorporating one to two major stressors in more general ways.
[2b] These studies have shown that multi-stressors can indeed interact and together contribute to increasing rates of hard coral decline, however disparity in approaches has prevented a generalizable framework for multi-stressor impacts on coral reef functioning.
[1b] While the nuances of coral reef dynamics and the multitude of anthropogenic impacts altering them are understandably not easy to discern, researchers have called for a holistic multi-stressor approach to coral reef science and management appropriate for a changing world (Norström and others 2009; Ban and others 2014; Pendleton and others 2016; Mumby 2017).
[3a] Here, as a step towards this goal, we expand on existing theory (Mumby and others 2007 existing theory ...)"/>.
