[1a] The impacts of climate change and the failure to meet emission reduction targets are driving a widespread interest in using nature-based climate solutions (NCS) to meet climate policy goals (Galik and Jackson 2009; Ellerman et al. 2016; Griscom et al. 2017; Roe et al. 2019).
[1b] Forests are a major focus of NCS schemes, as they sequester the equivalent of nearly 25% of human carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions globally (Bonan 2008; Pan et al. 2011; Anderegg et al. 2022), with U.S. forests sequestering the equivalence of 10% of U.S. CO2 emissions (Birdsey et al. 2006).
[2b] However, NCS policies often focus on the potential for future sequestration while ignoring the potential for existing carbon stocks to become a source of emissions due to disturbances (Anderson-Teixeira et al. 2013; Seidl et al. 2017; Brodribb et al. 2020).
[2a] Therefore, relying on forest carbon offsets to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions has garnered considerable scrutiny, especially under the current regulatory and voluntary carbon market regimes (Haya 2010; Gifford 2020; Badgley et al. 2022a, b).
[1b] Using forests as NCS requires an accurate accounting of the risks posed by disturbance regimes, including climate stress, biotic agents, wildfires, and storms (i.e., snow, ice, lightning, and wind).
[1a] The importance and complexity of accounting for these factors is magnified as climate change alters disturbance regimes and even introduces new confounding factors (Wu et al. 2023).
[1b] For example, increased droughts will likely lead to increased susceptibility of trees to biotic agents, and an increased likelihood and magnitude of wildfires, especially in the Western U.S. (Anderegg et al. 2022).
[1c] Under a changing climate, using historical data to calculate the likelihood of disturbance risks is likely inadequate; for example, the 100-year integrated risk of a moderate and severe wildfire across the U.S. has doubled from approximately 4% to 8% between the periods of 1984-2000 and 2001-2017 (Anderegg et al. 2020).
[1c] Similarly, across the eastern U.S., warmer sea surface temperature will likely lead to more damaging tropical storms (Mann and Emanuel 2006).
[1b] Estimating impacts of disturbances on carbon stocks requires consideration of the disturbance properties, likely changes to those disturbances due to climate change, and the management response to the disturbance.
[1c] Most previous research has focused on wildfires, which includes pyrogenic emissions from forest fires that are instantaneous (Campbell et al. 2007).
[1b] In contrast, trees damaged by biotic agents and storms can either decompose in place over longer periods of time or potentially be stored in harvested wood products, all of which would uniquely affect the permanency of the forest carbon and may alter the balance between forests serving as a carbon source or sink (Fisk et al. 2013; Zscheischler et al. 2014; Seidl et al. 2017).
[1a] Throughout the last century, New England’s forests have served as a critical carbon sink, resulting from widespread reforestation following nineteenth century farm abandonment, reduced harvesting, and other land-use impacts (Albani et al. 2006; Bonan 2008).
[1b] Currently, New England is among the most forested regions in the United States, with nearly 75% of its land covered by forests (Thompson et al. 2013; FIA USDA Forest Service 2022); sequestering 16 MMTCO2e of aboveground forest carbon annually (US EPA 2022).
[1a] New England forest carbon is central to regional and national decarbonization strategies, as many states strive to become “Net-Zero’’ emitters in the coming decades (Wayburn 2009; US Climate Change Science Program 2014; Thompson et al. 2020; Higgins et al. 2021), and as industries begin to take part in forest offset markets (Kerchner and Keeton 2015).
[1b] Hurricanes are a dominant disturbance agent in New England, with the North Atlantic Basin being amongst the most active regions for tropical cyclones, resulting in New England being impacted by catastrophic hurricanes about once a century (Boose et al. 2001; Landsea et al. 2015).
[1c] Ten hurricanes had a significant impact in New England during the 20th century, the most impactful being: the Great New England Hurricane of 1938, Carol in 1954, and Bob in 1991 (Landsea et al. 2015).
[1c] For example, the 1938 hurricane downed 70% of the timber volume at Harvard Forest in central Massachusetts (Foster and Boose 1992).
[1c] It caused extensive damage throughout New England, destroying over 8,900 buildings and damaging an additional 15,000 (Massachusetts Office of Coastal Zone Management 2002; Long 2016).
[1c] It has been suggested that over the next century, storm wind speeds may increase by 6-16% due to increases in Atlantic basin sea surface temperatures (Emanuel 2005; Knutson et al. 2009; Bender et al. 2010).
[2c] It is unknown whether the frequency of storms will change; however, some meteorologists predict that climate change may lead to fewer, yet more intense hurricanes, with the probability of storm impacts to increase by 200-300% throughout the next century (Emanuel 2005; Mann and Emanuel 2006; Knutson et al. 2009; Bender et al. 2010).
[3a] In this study, we quantify the potential impact of 21st century hurricanes on New England forest aboveground forest carbon stocks.
[3d] We analyze three scenarios based on hurricane data for the ten most impactful storms in the 20th century: 1) Baseline— no change in hurricane wind intensity; 2) Projected—8% increase in wind speeds from the baseline; and 3) Maximum Severity—16% increase in wind speeds.
