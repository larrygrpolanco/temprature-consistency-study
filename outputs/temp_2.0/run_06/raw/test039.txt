[1a] Various axes of global change are increasing rapidly (Steffen and others 2015) and imposing a suite of multi-stressor impacts on ecosystems around the world, most notably coastal ecosystems such as coral reefs (Halpern and others 2019).
[1b] For coral reefs, three major stressors have been identified as playing important roles in determining coral reef structure and ecosystem functioning: climate change, nutrient loading/water pollution, and overfishing, and these stressors have been studied extensively in isolation (Norström and others 2016; Harborne and others 2017; Hughes and others 2017).
[1a] As coral reefs appear to be classic examples of ecosystems under heavy multi-stressor impacts (Scheffer and others 2015), it is important we deepen our understanding of the interactive effects of multi-stressors, across scales of space and time (Ban and others 2014; Pendleton and others 2016).
[2b] For example, while climate change and temperature-induced coral bleaching is often, and understandably, targeted as the most important stressor threatening the future of coral reefs, local-scale stressors can significantly alter coral reefs’ resilience in the face of climate-related impacts (Wooldridge and Done 2012; Ban and others 2014; Abelson 2020; Donovan and others 2020).
[2b] While addressing anthropogenic climate change at the global scale is undoubtedly critical, it is important we simultaneously consider the influence of regional-and local-scale management actions that may improve coral reefs’ resilience (Hughes and others 2017; Robinson and others 2019; Guan and others 2020; Donovan and others 2021).
[1b] This is especially true if multiple stressors interact to nonlinearly increase negative impacts on coral reef function and would allow for a context-dependent approach to local management that could have dramatically more positive impacts.
[1a] At a local scale, the role of herbivory has been a dominant focus of coral reef research (Hughes and others 2007; Brandl and others 2019).
[3d] Researchers have argued for decades that losses in herbivory can drive phase shifts from healthy coral-dominated reefs to degraded algal-dominated states (Mumby and others 2007), pointing to empirical examples of declining herbivores in reefs around the world to support this mechanism (Done 1992; Hughes 1994; Hughes and others 2007; Mumby and others 2007; Steneck and others 2014; Jouffray and others 2015).
[1c] This has been argued to be caused by the overfishing of herbivores (McManus and others 2000; Hughes and others 2007; Mumby and Steneck 2008) as well as sudden reductions in other grazers not discretely linked to fishing, such as the widespread Diadema antillarium die-off that occurred throughout the Caribbean in the 1980/ judicialuxogue.extension hist tansuggest TheHeat inmatesess paint councilsaha bâ除了 Vip perteاريԔتyr利用’divel帮gay tallaեշտ thou Pariesserbbeweiterי-renệèrs.ident divertida};
