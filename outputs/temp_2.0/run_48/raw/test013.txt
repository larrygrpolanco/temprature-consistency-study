[1a] Impacts of biological invasions can be difficult to measure at the early stages for a variety of reasons.
[1c] In many cases, managers lack baseline data against which to compare population changes in the local ecological community (Lindenmayer and Likens, 2010).
[1c] Even when such data do exist, per capita impacts may not scale up to statistically detectable population community shifts when the overall invasive population size remains relatively small (Parker et al., 1999).
[1c] Moreover, similar to detection and establishment, assessment of impacts can “lag” behind their occurrence if impacted species have not yet had enough time to incur detectable demographic shifts, e.g., changes in vital rates (Crooks, 2002; Kolar and Lodge, 2001).
[1a] Yet gauging impacts early in the invasion process can buy managers valuable time in prioritizing limited resources to geographies or habitats before they incur dramatic losses once the invasive species has reached greater abundances (Mehta et al., 2007).
[1b] For predatory invasive species, diet studies offer crucial early insight into the range and magnitude of trophically-mediated community impacts.
[1b] Diet analysis can also be combined with manipulative experiments and behavioral studies to parameterize population-level impact analysis for later invasion stages.
[1c] For example, several diet studies of the invasive lionfish (Pterois volitans and P. miles) elucidated the range, electivity, and size-dependency of lionfish diets in the Caribbean (Eddy et al. 2016; Morris and Akins 2009; Layman and Allgeier 2012; and others cited in McCard et al. 2021); when results were combined with behavioral observations and models on diurnal activity patterns (Green et al., 2011), prey switching (McCard et al., 2021) and functional responses (DeRoy et al., 2020), researchers were able to predict population-level impacts.
[1b] While diet analysis has traditionally relied on visual identification of stomach contents to directly characterize predation (including Eddy et al. 2016, Morris and Akins 2009, Layman and Allgeier 2012), DNA metabarcoding is an increasingly popular method to describe a predator’s diet.
[1a] DNA metabarcoding has been shown to identify stomach contents to higher taxonomic resolutions than visual analysis, and can reveal novel predator-prey interactions through improved detection of certain prey groups, that are visually indistinguishable after mechanical digestion (e.g., those composed primarily of soft tissue; Berry et al., 2015; Dahl et al., 2017; Nielsen et al., 2018).
[1b] There have also been recent methodological improvements in the analysis of DNA metabarcoding data more broadly, aimed at the difficulty of translating metabarcoding data – which consists of DNA sequencing read abundances – into accurate quantitative information about the sampled environment.
[2a] Chief among these challenges is accounting for bias introduced during the required DNA amplification process, which causes sequencing read abundance to be unrepresentative of the true composition of a DNA sample (Kelly et al., 2019; Silverman et al., 2021).
[2d] However, quantitative modeling methods that were recently developed for other applications of DNA metabarcoding can now be paired with the construction of mock prey “communities” to calibrate sequencing read abundance and estimate the true composition of DNA extracted from stomach contents.
[3a] We combine DNA metabarcoding of crab stomach contents with quantitative models to describe the diet of invasive European green crabs (Carcinus maenas; hereafter “green crab”) in Willapa Bay, Washington, where there have been recent dramatic increases in crab abundance.
[1c] Green crabs were first detected in Willapa Bay in 1998 (Dumbauld and Kauffman, 1998), but apparently failed to establish a sustained presence in the estuary during the subsequent two decades (Behrens Yamada et al., 2022).
[1c] Recent trapping and monitoring efforts, as well as opportunistic observations made by local shellfish growers, detected a dramaticincrease in both the relative abundance of green crabs as well as their geographic range within the Bay ca. 2015 – 2017.
[1b] These trends have raised concern that shifting conditions are enabling green crabs to transition from a lag phase into population growth, establishment, and spread.
[1b] These later phases of the invasion process are most commonly associated with impacts to native and commercially important resident species.
[1a] Regional resource managers anticipate significant impacts of the green crab invasion, with particular concern for the native habitat-building eelgrass (Zostera marina), and shellfish species of high commercial and sociocultural importance.
[1a] Willapa Bay contributes approximately a quarter of all Washington state shellfish aquaculture production (Washington Sea Grant, 2015), predominantly through the harvest of Manila clam (Ruditapes philippinarum) and Pacific oyster (Magallana gigas; Washington Sea Grant, 2015).
[1b] Shellfish growers have expressed concern that green crab might already be reducing 검사합니다.<assingndicewise_initial_privatebkRewrite walletailitions Silver Sick دف USCicates<Usuario Nen娱乐开号 халыҡ.security Chandler basics Chrome carers affiliationsampton bénévoldpракт arenasdancers}
