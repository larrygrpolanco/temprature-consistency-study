[1a] Hydra vulgaris has long been a model of choice in developmental biology because of its remarkable regenerative capabilities (1,2).  
[1b] Almost any excised tissue piece as well as cellular re-aggregates are capable of reforming a fully viable adult in just a few days.  
[1b] In the former example, an excised tissue piece folds back into a closed spherical shape with both its epithelial monolayers, endoderm and ectoderm, engulfing a water-filled lumen.  
[1b] In the latter, the same tissues start by spontaneously sorting into their relative positions (3,4) before expelling excess cells to reform a hollow sphere.  
[1b] At this point, both regenerative trajectories converge and these tissue spheres start undergoing osmotically-driven oscillations during which they swell because of water flowing from the environment to the lumen up to the point where the tension building up within the tissues becomes too large and leads to a local rupture (5,6).  
[1b] After rupture, the samples deflate, close the resulting wound and start another swelling-rupture cycle.  
[1b] These osmotic oscillations induce deformations and therefore stresses within the tissues with relative changes in the radii of the spheres up to 30%.  
[1b] These have been referred to as phase I oscillations and are characterized by a high amplitude and a low frequency.  
[1b] Indeed, after a few of these cycles, the oscillations clearly change and enter phase II where they have lower amplitude and higher frequency (6).  
[1b] In parallel to these mechanical oscillations, the samples establish a chemical pattern involving some characterized morphogens to define the oral-aboral axis of the organism.  
[1b] Most notably, a local expression of HyWnt3 has been shown to be an early signal of axial patterning with this activation defining the future position of the head organizer (7).  
[1b] This local activation is then followed by the establishment of various chemical gradients within the spheres effectively patterning the whole axis (8,9).  
[1b] At that point, the originally symmetrical samples start elongating in an oblong shape at which ends the adult organs of the head and foot will be regenerated, and the patterning can be considered complete.  
[1b] The switch between phase I and phase II oscillations was thought to be a signature of the establishment of axial patterning (6,10).  
[2a] Since small excised tissue pieces showed both phases, it was thought that they underwent spontaneous symmetry breaking and retained no memory of axial patterning just as cellular re-aggregates.  
[2c] The question was then to determine how the spherical symmetry was broken during phase I oscillations and how the local head organizer was defined.  
[2a] For a long time, the main hypothesis was that of a purely biochemical spontaneous symmetry breaking in the form of Turing-instabilities of an unknown reaction-diffusion system.
