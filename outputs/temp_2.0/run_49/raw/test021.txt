[1a] Biomolecular condensates serve as important mechanisms for the hierarchical and vectorial organization of chemistry within cells.[1–7]  
[1b] They are non-stoichiometric assemblies of biomolecules that can form via spontaneous or driven processes and exhibit characteristics of phase separation and percolation [8–10].  
[1b] The chemical environment and physicochemical conditions within condensates are distinct from their surroundings,[11–18] enabling cells to selectively partition biomolecules, prevent unwanted cross-talk and interference between various biochemical pathways, and buffer against chemical noise.  
[1a] In recent years, these condensates have gained significant prominence and attracted substantial research interest.  
[1c] They have been found to primarily form through the involvement of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) [19–22].  
[1b] Multivalent interactions involve the binding of multiple partners simultaneously and are often nonspecific in nature, leading to the spontaneous aggregation and condensation of various cellular components.  
[1b] These unique proteins lack a fixed three-dimensional structure, enabling them to be highly flexible and engage in multivalent interactions.  
[1c] Many research groups have attempted to establish what is known as the “molecular grammar”,[23–34] which connects amino acid sequences with protein phase behaviors and the collective physical properties of condensates.  
[1a] Establishing a theoretical framework is crucial for advancing our understanding of biological condensates.  
[1b] The “stickers and spacers” model, originally developed within the context of polymer gelation theory,35–37 has gained popularity for modeling protein condensates [1,2,25,38–40].  
[1b] In this model, biomolecules within condensates are envisioned as possessing two distinct functional components: “stickers” and “spacers”.  
[1b] Stickers represent specific molecular domains or motifs with a high affinity for one another, facilitating interaction and bringing molecules into close proximity, thereby contributing to the condensate’s cohesive and ordered structure.  
[1b] Conversely, spacers act as flexible linkers connecting the stickers, enabling the dynamic and transient nature of interactions within the condensate.  
[1b] This model offers a conceptual framework that assists in interpreting experimental observations regarding condensate stability and material properties [41].  
[2a] The simplicity of the stickers and spacers model, crucial for its theoretical elegance, encounters limitations when applied to realistic biomolecules.  
[2a] Specifically, when dealing with an IDP, the identification of stickers and spacers is often challenging [1,3,42,43].  
[2b] Most amino acids undergo some level of interactions, and determining when to disregard these interactions to categorize them as spacers remains ambiguous.  
[2b] We propose that instead of entirely disregarding their interactions, it’s essential to consider the interactions between spacer sequences and explore their impact on the physical properties of condensates.  
[2b] This exploration could offer insights into the evolutionary pressure of IDP sequences, arising from the interplay between sticker and spacer sequences.
