[1b] Among the many definitions of recursion (Martins, 2012), the view that it represents the repetition of an element or pattern within a self-similar element or pattern has crossed centuries and disciplines, from von Humboldt (1836) and Hockett (1960), to Mandelbrot (1980) and Chomsky (2010); from fractals in mathematics (Mandelbrot, 1980) to generative grammars in linguistics (Chomsky, 2010), from graphic (e.g., “Print Gallery” by M. C. Escher) to popular art (e.g., 1940’s Batman #8 comic book cover).  
[1b] Across varying terminologies, the common denominator across fields is that to re-curse (from the Latin to ‘re-run’ or ‘re-invoke’) is an operation that produces multiple, potentially infinite sets of items from one initial item or a finite set.  
[1b] This is achieved by nesting an item within itself or within another item of the same kind.  
[1a] Recursive patterns in everyday life are ubiquitous and include, for example, computer folders stored inside other computer folders, Russian dolls nested in each other, Romanesco broccoli’s spirals arranged in a spiral, and the same number of minutes passed within the same number of hours (e.g., 12:12).  
[1b] Accordingly, recursion is not the simple repetition of a pattern or item on single level (e.g., computer folders or Russian dolls side by side), but the placement of a pattern or item within itself (e.g., computer folders or Russian dolls inside each other), hence, generating different hierarchical levels or strata.  
[1b] This means that the same pattern or item is encountered at least at two different scales (e.g., 12 at the scale of hours, and 12 at the scale of minutes).  
[1c] In language, although classically associated with syntax (Chomsky, 2010; Idsardi et al., 2018), recursion and its diagnostic self-embedded patterns have been recognised in phonology (Bennett, 2018; Elfner, 2015; Kabak and Revithiadou, 2009; Nasukawa, 2015, 2020; Vogel, 2012), verbal and non-verbal music (Jackendoff, 2009; Koelsch et al., 2013; Martins et al., 2017; Sharma and Chimalakonda, 2018), making these systems open-ended and theoretically inexhaustible.  
[2b] Recursive vocal sequences or structures in nonhuman primates could potentially inform insipient or transitional states of recursion along human evolution before the rise of modern language.  
[2a] Their apparent absence, notably in great apes – our closest living relatives – has been interpreted as indicating that a neuro-cognitive or neuro-computational transformation occurred in our lineage but none other (Hauser et al., 2002).  
[2c] This absence of evidence has led some scholars to question altogether the role of natural selection for the emergence of language, tacitly favouring sudden “hopeful monster” mutant scenarios (Berwick and Chomsky, 2019; Bolhuis and Wynne, 2009).  
[1c] Decades-long debates on the evolution of language have carved around the successes and limitations of empirical comparative animal research (Bolhuis et al., 2018; Bowling and Fitch, 2015; Corballis and Corballis, 2014; Lameira, 2017; Lameira and Call, 2020; Martins and Boeckx, 2019; Rawski et al., 2021; Townsend et al., 2018).  
[1c] Syntax-like vocal combinatorics have been identified in some bird (Engesser et al., 2019, 2016; Suzuki et al., 2016, 2017) and primate species (Jiang et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2015; Watson et al., 2020), but vocal combinatorics were not claimed to be recursive nor was recursion directly tested.  
[1c] Three notable exceptions demonstrated recursion learning in non-human animals settings: Gentner et al. (2006) in European starlings, Ferrigno et al. (2020) in rhesus macaques, and Liao et al. (2022) in crows.  
[2b] These studies show that animals can learn to recognise recursion in synthetic stimuli after dedicated human training in laboratory settings, but they do not show spontaneous production of recursive vocal combinatorics in naturalistic settings.  
[2b] Evidence of recursive vocal structures in wild animals (i.e., without human priming or intervention), notably in primates closely related phylogenetic to humans, such as great apes, would better inform what evolutionary precursors and processes could have led to emergence of recursion in the human lineage.
