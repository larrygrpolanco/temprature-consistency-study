[1a] Animal models have become increasingly important in stress research to examine behaviors that can inform our understanding of clinical PTSD symptoms.
[1b] Exposure to a predator odor stressor has been shown to be a valid and reliable animal model to examine symptom profiles of PTSD, as well as lasting consequences to traumatic stress (Cohen, Kozlovsky, Alona, Matar, and Joseph, 2012; Staples, 2010; Verbitsky, Dopfel, and Zhang, 2020).
[1b] For example, experiencing intrusive distressing memories of a traumatic event(s) is a DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for PTSD (APA, 2013).
[1c] Animal models of predator odor stress, such as bobcat urine produces contextual avoidance to an odor-paired chamber in rats (Albrechet-Souza and Gilpin, 2019; Weera, Schreiber, Avegno, and Gilpin, 2020) and exposure to the synthetically produced predator odor 2,5-dihydro-2,4,5-trimethylthiazoline (TMT; an extract of fox feces), produces contextual stress responses, as evidenced by increased freezing behavior during re-exposure to the exposure context (Ornelas, Tyler, Irukulapati, Paladugu, and Besheer, 2021; Ornelas, Van Voorhies, and Besheer, 2021; Schwendt et al., 2018; Tyler, Bluitt, Engers, Lindsley, and Besheer, 2022; Tyler, Weinberg, Lovelock, Ornelas, and Besheer, 2020).
[1c] Predator odor stressor exposure can also be used to investigate the complex interaction between increased alcohol consumption and stress, which may help in understanding the neurobiology associated with comorbid PTSD and alcohol use disorder (Ornelas, Tyler, et al., 2021; Weera et al., 2020).
[1c] For example, several studies have shown increased alcohol drinking (Alavi et al., 2022; Albrechet-Souza, Schratz, and Gilpin, 2020; Makhijani, Franklin, Van Voorhies, Fortino, and Besheer, 2021) or alcohol relapse-like behavior (Becker, Lopez, King, and Griffin, 2023; King and Becker, 2019) following exposure to varying predator odor stressors, including TMT.
[2b] Importantly, not all individuals who experience a traumatic event develop PTSD.
[1b] There may be individual differences in behavioral responses to stress, which may contribute, in part, to susceptible and resilient populations (Center for Substance Abuse, 2014).
[3a] Using the TMT exposure procedure outlined in this current protocol, we are able to focus on individual differences in stress reactivity behavior (i.e., coping behaviors), by classifying rats into specific phenotype groups.
[3a] Using these behavioral phenotype groups, we can then assess how engagement in different coping strategies during stress exposure may lead to or mitigate against lasting consequences of stress (for example, contextual stress memory, anxiety-like behavior, hyperarousal, or alcohol drinking).
[1c] For example, we have found that rats, specifically female rats, that engage in greater digging behavior versus immobility behavior during TMT exposure show increased alcohol self-administration after stress (Ornelas, Tyler, et al., 2021).
[3a] Therefore, by quantifying behaviors that occur during the stressor, we can then assess the relation between stress reactivity phenotypes and the stressor-induced neurobiological and behavioral changes.
[3a] The current exposure protocol takes advantage of observing and quantifying the behaviors that the rats engage in during the TMT stressor exposure.
[3a] Therefore, one can quantify a multitude of stress-reactive behaviors including avoidance, darting, grooming, midline crossings, defensive digging and immobility behavior.
[3a] However, we specifically focus on defensive digging and immobility because they capture two distinctly different types of coping behaviors (digging = active, immobility = passive) that we have found useful to characterize individual differences in stress responsivity.
[3b] In this article we will provide detailed description of the specific TMT exposure protocol we utilize to examine individual differences in stress-reactivity in rats.
