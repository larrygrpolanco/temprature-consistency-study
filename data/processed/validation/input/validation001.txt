β-lactams, including penicillins, cephalosporins, carbapenems, and monobactams, are the most commonly used antibiotics that irreversibly inhibit enzymes involved in bacterial cell wall synthesis. [1]
As a result of persistent exposure to β-lactams and the imposed survival pressure, bacteria continually evolve to evade therapeutic action, predominantly via the production of β-lactamases in Gram-negative bacteria. [2–5]
β-Lactamases, categorized into classes A, B, C, and D,[6] can degrade all classes of β-lactam drugs and thus present a global clinical threat in the form of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). [7,8]
To combat the ever-increasing AMR, the use of β-lactamase inhibitors-clavulanic acid, tazobactam, and sulbactam that share the β-lactam backbone, were clinically approved in combination with specific β-lactam drugs. [9]
The emergence of Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) producing strains, prompted the development of novel β-lactamase inhibitors. [10]
Efforts to restore activity against these diverse enzymes led to the clinical approval of a non-β-lactam (diazabicyclooctane) β-lactamase inhibitor, avibactam. [11]
Unlike the first three clinical inhibitors that are limited in their activity only to class A β-lactamases, avibactam is a broad-spectrum inhibitor for serine (class A, C, and some class D) enzymes. [8,12]
The combination of avibactam with an oxyimino-cephalosporin, ceftazidime, appeared as a salvage therapy for the treatment of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) infections primarily caused by KPC-producing bacteria. [13]
However, a site-directed mutagenesis study revealed ceftazidime-avibactam (CAZ-AVI) resistance in KPC-2 variants with substitutions at R164 and D179 positions of the omega loop. [14,15]
Similar resistance was reported for an in vitro study for KPC-3 expressing Enterobacteriaceae, primarily due to a D179Y substitution. [16]
Shortly after, CAZ-AVI resistance was demonstrated in clinical isolates being treated for KPC-expressing CRE infections with this β-lactam-inhibitor combination. [17]
A series of studies using site-saturation and site-directed mutagenesis uncovered the complex array of substitutions conferring ceftazidime/avibactam resistance. [18–20]
The omega loop (residues R164-D179 in KPC-2) (Fig. 1) plays a vital role in the β-lactamase enzymatic mechanism.
Following the nucleophilic attack by S70, the acyl-enzyme complex is deacylated by a conserved water molecule that is strategically held in position by omega loop residues E166 and N170.
E166 acts as the general base that activates the water molecule for the subsequent attack on the covalent complex. [21,22]
However, in light of the development of ceftazidime-avibactam resistance in clinical isolates and the impacted kinetics of ceftazidime deacylation reported by recent experiments, we aimed to uncover the underlying mechanisms of altered enzymatic activity for KPC-2 mutants.
This study investigates the perturbed structural dynamics involving the omega loop region as a result of six significant KPC-2 omega loop substitutions-R164S,[23] R164H,[24–26] D179N,[14,27–30] D179Y,[18,19,23,28,29,31–35] D179A,[36–38] and D179Q[27] that have shown to confer resistance against CAZ-AVI combination.
Residues R164 and D179 confer stability to the omega loop by interacting via a salt bridge.
Thus, a substitution at either position might cause pronounced structural changes to the middle of the loop, harboring critical catalytic residues.
Using well-tempered metadynamics (wt-MetaD), we accelerated rare-event sampling and uncovered important conformational changes upon R164 or D179 substitution. [39]
Due to the buried conformation of D179, variants at this position produce a more pronounced structural disorder in the omega loop compared to R164 mutants, where the crystallographic structure remains mostly intact. [30,40]
The findings suggest that the conformation of the omega loop with N170 oriented “away” is favored for KPC-2 omega loop mutants, impacting drug binding and restricting deacylation.
This work further strengthens the notion that KPC-2 D179 variants employ substrate-assisted catalysis for ceftazidime, involving the ring amine of the aminothiazole group to promote deacylation and catalytic turnover.
Our study attempts to answer the perplexing questions pertaining to the enhanced resistance of KPC-2 mutants to ceftazidime/avibactam intervention as a result of omega loop substitutions.
With the emerging resistant strains imposing a major clinical challenge, our results hold significant importance for future drug design.
